          <blockquote>Open access is important because it can give power and resources back to academics and universities; because it rightly makes research more widely and publically available; and because, like it or not, it’s beginning and this is our brief chance to shape its future so that it benefits all of us in the humanities and social sciences.<cite>Robert Eaglestone, Professor of Contemporary Literature and Thought, Royal Holloway, University of London</cite></blockquote>

          <blockquote>For scholars, open access is the most important movement of our times. It offers an unprecedented opportunity to open up our research to the world, irrespective of readers' geographical, institutional or financial limitations. We cannot falter in pursuing a fair academic landscape that facilitates such a shift, without transferring prohibitive costs onto scholars themselves in order to maintain unsustainable levels of profit for some parts of the commercial publishing industry.<cite>Dr Caroline Edwards, Lecturer in Modern & Contemporary Literature, Birkbeck, University of London</cite></blockquote>
