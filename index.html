          <blockquote>Open access is important because it can give power and resources back to academics and universities; because it rightly makes research more widely and publically available; and because, like it or not, it’s beginning and this is our brief chance to shape its future so that it benefits all of us in the humanities and social sciences.<cite>Robert Eaglestone, Professor of Contemporary Literature and Thought, Royal Holloway, University of London</cite></blockquote>

          <blockquote>For scholars, open access is the most important movement of our times. It offers an unprecedented opportunity to open up our research to the world, irrespective of readers' geographical, institutional or financial limitations. We cannot falter in pursuing a fair academic landscape that facilitates such a shift, without transferring prohibitive costs onto scholars themselves in order to maintain unsustainable levels of profit for some parts of the commercial publishing industry.<cite>Dr Caroline Edwards, Lecturer in Modern & Contemporary Literature, Birkbeck, University of London</cite></blockquote>

          <blockquote>Technology allows for efficient worldwide dissemination of research and scholarship. But closed distribution models can get in the way. Open access helps to fulfill the promise of the digital age. It benefits the public by making knowledge freely available to everyone, not hidden behind paywalls. It also benefits authors by maximizing the impact and dissemination of their work.<cite>Jennifer Jenkins, Senior Lecturing Fellow and Director, Center for the Study of the Public Domain, Duke University</cite></blockquote>

          <blockquote>Our open access monograph The History Manifesto argues for breaking down the barriers between academics and wider publics: open-access publication achieved that. The impact was immediate, global and uniquely gratifying--a chance to inject ideas straight into the bloodstream of civic discussion around the world. Kudos to Cambridge University Press for supporting innovation!<cite>David Armitage, Professor and Chair of the Department of History, Harvard University and co-author of <a href="http://historymanifesto.cambridge.org">The History Manifesto</a></cite></blockquote>
